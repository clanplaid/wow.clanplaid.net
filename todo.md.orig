# Todo

What are some of the known things that need to be done?

## Tests

* Add unit test coverage for user, user plugin and user mailer
* Add unit test coverage for inquiry mailer and inquiry setting
* Add functional tests for the whole of Refinery.

# Rails 3.0 Support

We've started an effort to move to Rails 3.0 - that just needs to be completed.

# Improve the Generator

We need to have support for build in Refinery field types like "image". So I could run

  ./script/generate refinery staff name:string bio:text mugshot:image
  
And it will automatically create a form field that pops open the image picker on the staff form.

There is now a partial to easily call an image picker.

# Todos required for 1.0 release

## Solid Test Coverage

* Add Cucumber for the whole of Refinery. (top priority)
* Add RSpec for the whole of Refinery, particularly:
  - User, User plugin and User mailer
  - Inquiry mailer and Inquiry setting

## Rails 3.0 Support

We've started an effort to move to Rails 3.0 - that just needs to be completed.

Join the IRC channel on freenode.net #refinerycms on August 7th to contribute!

## I18n support

* Check all the views for missing translations
  - You can run a rake task with your locale e.g for Slovenian:
  ``rake translate:lost_in_translation LOCALE=sl``
    
* Translate models and model attributes used in forms (Rails 2.3.8 supports translation form labels!)
* Javascript messages etc:
  - http://github.com/fnando/i18n-js
* Add in i18n support for the front-end as well

## Plugin API

* Install process, update process, copying assets to public
* All these things should be made standard so that it is easier for plugin authors
* Most plugins should be packaged as gems for ease
* Standardize the naming (refinerycms-[plugin_name]), most do this already but there are a few exceptions

# Internet Explorer 7+ Support

* WYMEditor and the dialogs are the weakest areas right now.

# Organise a party and media for 1.0 release

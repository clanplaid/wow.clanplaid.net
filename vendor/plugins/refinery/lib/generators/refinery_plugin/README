== Refinery Plugin Generator

== Description

Generates a custom plugin for Refinery automatically. It works very similar to the Rails scaffold generator.

A generated plugin gives you all the basic files needed to manage the model the plugin will be for.

The first attribute should always be the one which is the title or name of the model.

There must be at least one attribute.

== Supported Field Types

string   - standard input box
text     - text area with a visual editor
image    - link to an image picker dialogue
resource - link to a resource picker dialogue

== Usage
./script/generate refinery_plugin singular_name attribute:type [attribute2:type ...]

== Example
./script/generate refinery_plugin product title:string description:text image:image brochure:resource
